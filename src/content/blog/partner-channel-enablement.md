Selling through channel partners can be a highly effective strategy for expanding your reach and driving revenue growth.

>Companies that have already deployed SE platforms to their partners are up to 2.3x more effective at achieving their sales goals and report 1.4x higher revenue growth.

>(Forrester, 2018)

However, enabling these external sales teams comes with its own unique set of challenges that many organizations struggle to overcome.

The first obvious reason is your partners are not part of the internal sales team. So they are **not privy to the base organisational knowledge** that any of your salespeople would easily absorb when they onboard.




They are not part of your daily culture either, for the knowledge to be reinforced continually.




And, the **salespeople in the partner organisation are far removed from the enablement team and rarely interact**, if ever. 



Not to mention, the partners often work with multiple vendorsa and **their attention is split across different vendor organisations** as they work with multiple partner programs.




Yet, they are the face of your company for the end users your partners bring in, and the lens through which your end users will see you.




So, partner enablement programs plays a highly crucial role in the success of any vendor organisation who rely on partners for a significant portion of their sales pie.




### Challenges Specific to Partner Enablement




Channel partner enablement and sales enablement share some similarities, but they have distinct differences in their focus, scope, and execution.




#### Exponential Increase in Your Sales Team

Your sales team is no longer the people under you in your organisation, but the sales teams in all the partner organisations too.

>The companies we surveyed work with an average of 176 partner companies to sell their products and services. 
>(Forrester, 2018)


#### Different Personas

Sales Enablement focuses on empowering external partners, such as resellers, distributors, and system integrators, to sell and support products or services. And oh, every partner organisation may have many influencers, decision makers and sellers within each Partner Organisation. Channel enablement is concerned with the entire partner ecosystem and the indirect sales channel. It is important to understand all the personas involved in the partnership ecosystem.

>These channel partners range from exclusive sales contracts to preferred partnerships to relationships with companies that sell a variety of brands. The level of leverage and attention the enterprise receives from each partnership type varies widely, yet sales enablement leaders are tasked
with driving revenue across all channels.
>(Forrester, 2018)


#### Lack of Control

While there is more direct control and oversight over internal sales teams, the partners operate independently. The **actual sellers are several degrees removed from the channel enablement team**, with no direct lines of communication. So the enablement teams should do their best to have comprehensive and clear information in the channel materials and make onboarding and training as easy as possible. There should be clear guidelines and standards while allowing partners to adapt and customize materials to their specific needs and audiences.




#### Lack of Visibility

The Lack of Control also translates to **less direct access to sales data and visibility into partner activities**, requiring more indirect methods for tracking and optimization.




#### Training and Support

Channel Enablement need to provide customised training and support for external partners' Persona to get them onboard as quickly as possible. Focus needs to be on product knowledge, sales techniques, and sales materials tailored to the partner's specific needs and audience.

In fact, as per the IGS report,
>Channel partners take over a year to become fully productive.




#### Brand Consistency

Maintaining the Brand image is a challenge as the partner should also be able to adapt them to their own brands. Clear guidelines and standards are needed for brand consistency across the entire partner ecosystem,** ensuring that partners use approved logos, images, and messaging**.




#### Performance Measurement

Direct observations of the sales data and interviews are impossible. So lagging and indirect indicators are the only way to measure performance.


#### Competing with other Vendors

**A typical channel partner works with an average of 8 vendors at any time**. That is 8 times the enablement programs they are enrolled in and several multiples of products to sell. That just means, your enablement program should not just be better, but world class, to win the partner loyalty and increase the chances of them focusing on your channel program.


## Your Channel Partner Enablement Strategy

### Develop Partner Messaging and Training - Your Partner Enablement Strategy

1. How is it different from internal sales enablement training?




2. Partner messaging and training needs to be tailored for an external audience, not just your internal sales team. You need to communicate your value proposition, differentiators, and product details in a way that resonates with your partner organizations, who are several steps removed from your company.




2. What assets should one develop for an effective communicaiton of messaging, branding and training on the product?




3. You must create materials to "sell to" the partners themselves, convincing them of the benefits of partnering with your company. This includes things like partner program brochures, recruitment decks, and commercial value propositions.




4. In addition to "selling to" the partners, you also need to provide "sell through" materials for the partners to use with their own customers, such as end-user brochures, case studies, and demo content.




5. The training needs to cover not just product details, but also how to effectively sell and demo the solution. This includes technical training as well as sales training, often delivered through an LMS or other centralized platform.




6. You need to provide clear brand guidelines and marketing assets for the partners to use, to maintain consistency even as they create their own collateral.




7. The messaging and training must be localized for different regions and languages where your partners operate.
